# Chiron-klipper-config-stock

A basic config for a stock anycubic chiron to use klipper.

As of writing this, this config is running on:
- klipper v0.11.0-148
- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B Rev 1.2
- MainSail OS (from the raspberry pi imager tool)

This should not be considered a plug'n'play config, it is still a work in progress

If you are unable to flash the klipper firmware to your anycubic chiron, you might need to [setup a bootloader for the mainboard](https://github.com/gbit-is/Trigorilla-v0.0.2-burn-bootloader)
